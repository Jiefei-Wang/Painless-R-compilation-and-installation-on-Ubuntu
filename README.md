# Painless-R-compilation-and-installation-on-Ubuntu
Compiling R involves installing tons of dependencies, though there are many documents on the internet instructing you how to achieve it, they are kind of outdated. If you are a lazy guy as me and tired to search for the dependencies of R. This is the right recipe for you. Run the commands at a terminal and you will have all the ingredients ready.

Currently the code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS. R version :4.0 devel (2019-12-06 r77536). If you like it, please contribute to this project by providing your test result.

# Installing dependencies
## Option 1: Using package management(Recommended)

The build-in package management utility is a powerful tool to install all dependences for `R-base`. For installing them, you need to enable the source packages in your `/etc/apt/sources.list`. To do that, you can run
```
sudo perl -p -i -e's/# deb-src/deb-src/' /etc/apt/sources.list
```
To install the dependences, run
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt build-dep r-base
```
Note that this would not install the `devtools` dependences. Click [here](#devtools-package-dependencies) to see how to install them

## Option 2: Manually installing the dependences
### Mandatory packages
```
sudo apt-get install \
build-essential fort77 xorg-dev liblzma-dev libblas-dev gfortran \
gcc-multilib gobjc++ aptitude \
libreadline-dev libbz2-dev libpcre2-dev \
libcurl4 libcurl4-openssl-dev \
default-jre default-jdk openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre -y
```

### Optional packages

1. Recommended packages: Go to the top-level directory of the R sources, run
```
./tools/rsync-recommended
```

2. For building documents:
```
sudo apt-get install texinfo texlive texlive-fonts-extra -y
```

# R installation
## Export JAVA path
R requires a java path to find the include header. This is my personal setting, I am not sure if it will work for all system.
```
## Export a global environment for R to find the java path
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
```

### Compiling R
The code below compile R with all debugging information available and without the recommended packages
```
./configure CFLAGS='-g -O0' CXXFLAGS='-g -O0' --enable-R-shlib --enable-memory-profiling --without-recommended-packages
make
make check
sudo make install
```


# `devtools` package dependencies
```
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libgit2-dev -y
```

## Key words for search
These are the error message you will see if your system does not meet one or more dependence requirement

1. checking whether bzip2 support sufficesâ€¦ configure: error: bzip2 library and headers are required

2. Either pcre >= 8.32 or pcre2 library and headers are required

3. error: --with-readline=yes (default) and headers/libs are not available

4. WARNING: you cannot build PDF versions of the R manuals

5. WARNING: neither inconsolata.sty nor zi4.sty found: PDF vignettes and package manuals will not be rendered optimally
